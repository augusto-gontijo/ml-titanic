# What is this Project?

This is my approach on the "Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster" machine learning competition. </br>

The objective here is to try and predict if a passenger survived or not the Titanic disaster (more on that on the next section). </br>

This project consists in 2 parts:
* A notebook with complete EDA and feature engineering explanation.
* A .py file to generate the .csv submission file.

* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Feature Engineering
* Classification Algorithms:
    * Random Forest
    * Decision Tree
    * XGBoost
    * Logistic Regression
    * Gradient Boosting Classifier

# What was the Sinking of the Titanic?

The RMS Titanic sank in the early morning hours of 15 April 1912 in the North Atlantic Ocean, four days into her maiden voyage from Southampton to New York City. The largest ocean liner in service at the time, Titanic had an estimated 2,224 people on board when she struck an iceberg at around 23:40 (ship's time)[a] on Sunday, 14 April 1912. Her sinking two hours and forty minutes later at 02:20 (ship's time; 05:18 GMT) on Monday, 15 April, resulted in the deaths of more than 1,500 people, making it one of the deadliest peacetime maritime disasters in history.
